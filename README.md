# TheCocktail

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.4.3.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Web Pack

Run `ng eject` ejects your app and output the proper webpack configuration and scripts.
This command uses the same flags as ng build, generating webpack configuration to match those flags.

You can use --force to overwrite existing configurations. You can eject multiple times, to have a dev and prod config for instance, by renaming the ejected configuration and using the --force flag.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
